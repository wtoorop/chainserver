Building from repository

First generate all the autoconf cruft with:

	autoreconf -fi

Then configure.

If the required versions of libraries and header files are in a non-default
location (for example OpenSSL 1.1.0 installed in $HOME/local), indicate this
with user variables.  For example:

	./configure LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/local/lib" CFLAGS="-I$HOME/local/include"
